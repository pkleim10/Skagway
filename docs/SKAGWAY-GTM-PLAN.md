# Skagway go-to-market plan (Mach II Labs)

**Saved:** 2026-07-11  
**Updated:** 2026-07-23 — Library Lock superseded by user-chosen library/cache location on encrypted volumes  
**Status:** Planning / not executed  
**Canonical Cursor plan:** `~/.cursor/plans/licensing_trial_purchase_5b99b9a9.plan.md` (historical; **superseded** on Skagway pricing by this doc)  
**This copy:** [`docs/SKAGWAY-GTM-PLAN.md`](SKAGWAY-GTM-PLAN.md) in the Skagway repo — revisit here or in Cursor Plans.

**Overview:** Best Mac local video organizer + premium grid chrome (overlays/vignette); **free forever**; studio credibility first; site on machiilabs.com.

## Open todos

- [x] Developer ID/notarization + DMG pipeline (`scripts/package_dmg.sh`); ROADMAP Phase 4 aligned
- [x] Customer-facing rename to Skagway (locked 2026-07-11); display name, About, DMG, site before public launch
- [ ] machiilabs.com: `/skagway` landing; **free forever** messaging (no “pricing coming later”)
- [ ] machiilabs.com owned (Cloudflare). Add to Vercel; grey-cloud DNS; support@ Email Routing
- [ ] Screenshots, demo, Cinematica compare; category SEO; free-forever story
- [ ] Free-launch checklist (MacStories, Reddit, PH); clear free-forever promise on site
- [x] ~~Optional library lock~~ — **cancelled 2026-07-23** (superseded by library/cache home on encrypted volume; see Part D)
- [ ] Post-launch: iOS companion player (LAN stream + pair auth); Skagway Player
- [ ] Part F Track A: v1.0 readiness + organizer supremacy polish (perf, UX, reliability, docs)
- [ ] Part F Track B: grid chrome MVP; later B2 posters/TMDB; B3 AI Hollywood covers (BYO API key)
- [ ] Part F Track C: power gaps that win vs Cinematica (notes, richer search, auto-import, near-dupes)
- [ ] **Check for updates** — in-app Sparkle wired (`feature/sparkle-updates`); publish `Skagway.dmg` + `Skagway.appcast.xml` to `downloads.machiilabs.com` when that host is live (`docs/SPARKLE.md`)
- [ ] **Bug reporting / ticketing / communication** — clear user → studio channel (e.g. support@, GitHub Issues, and/or light in-app “Report a Problem…”); triage workflow Mach II Labs can actually keep up with

**Cancelled (superseded 2026-07-12):** Paddle / LicenseManager / founding Keychain / paid flip for newcomers / Buy CTAs for Skagway. Paid products (e.g. **Ketchikan**) are a separate Mach II Labs product — not Skagway.

**Cancelled (superseded 2026-07-23):** In-app Library Lock (password / Touch ID / encrypted GRDB). Privacy for catalog + cache = put them on the same encrypted volume as media via startup **Choose Folder…** (see Part D).

# Skagway go-to-market: free forever + website + marketing

## Recommendation (locked)


**Primary job of Skagway:** prove **Mach II Labs** ships serious Mac software — polish, performance, honesty — so future products inherit trust. **Not** predicated on a large market for video organizers. **Skagway itself is not a revenue product.** Goodwill and craft are the win.

**Free forever.** Full-featured, no trial clock, no paywall, no “founding then charge later.” **Professional product site** under **Mach II Labs** on **`machiilabs.com`**. Studio revenue (when it comes) is from other products (e.g. **Ketchikan** — trial + one-time purchase), never from locking Skagway.

**Why this product exists (locked, 2026-07-11; pricing clarified 2026-07-12)**
- First full app built with AI-assisted development (developer has decades of shipping experience; AI accelerated the build).
- Niche: local Mac video catalog/organizer — real users exist; not a mass market. Plan does **not** assume viral scale.
- Free forever + serious presentation = best ROI for **studio brand**: downloads, word-of-mouth, SEO footprints, “these people make real software.”
- Future Mach II Labs products sell easier if Skagway felt trustworthy and capable.
- Success metrics (in order): (1) polished public presence, (2) **best-in-class Mac local video organizer** (+ premium grid look), (3) users who’d recommend the studio, (4) category search visibility. **No Skagway revenue metric.**

**Monetization (locked, 2026-07-12)**
- **Skagway is free forever.** Full-featured, no trial, no paywall, no paid tier, no grandfather/cutoff story.
- **No subscriptions — ever** (Mach II Labs company rule).
- **Do not** plan a later paid flip for Skagway newcomers. That model is **retired**.
- **Tip jar:** Optional later nicety only — not the business model; never a substitute for clarity that the app is free.
- **Honest messaging from day one:** Site and press say **free forever**. No bait-and-switch language. No “free during launch.”
- **Studio paid products** (e.g. Ketchikan) are marketed separately; they must not imply Skagway will become paid.

**Privacy (locked, 2026-07-13)**
- **No app telemetry by default.** Skagway must not phone home with usage analytics, automatic diagnostics, library paths, play history, or similar without an explicit, informed user action.
- **Bug reports are user-initiated only.** Prefill may include app/OS version and the user’s own text; never silent upload of library content or browsing behavior.
- Studio **support-process** metrics (e.g. issue counts, time-to-close) are fine and are **not** app telemetry.
- Aligns with free-forever trust: local library software that respects the user’s files and privacy.

**Brand lock-in**
- **Studio display name:** Mach II Labs (Roman numeral — “Mach two”)
- **Only domain:** `machiilabs.com` — no other product domains, vanity `get*`, or `*.app` purchases. Everything ships under this host.
- **Product display name (locked, 2026-07-11):** **Skagway** — obscure Alaska place name; clear Infuse-grade + usability screen (no exact App Store consumer app; no major in-lane video/Mac twin). Soft footnotes only: town tourism at skagway.com; small Bengaluru hospitality SaaS at skagway.tech (not consumer Mac). Companion: **Skagway Player**.
- **Usability bar (locked after Truvo/Fern):** do not suggest names user can’t practically use — exact App Store consumer app with that name, or live major brand owning the word/.com. Soft SEO / place / pronunciation alone don’t kill. Common English words can work (Eagle DAM).
- **Screening rules (locked):** Only reject for reasons that would also kill Infuse / Peakto / VidHub / IINA / Eagle — (1) in-lane Mac video-library peer, (2) wrong product signal, (3) platform giant’s word. Empty Google / soft SEO / metaphor / pronunciation / descriptiveness do **not** disqualify.
- **Also considered (not chosen):** VideoHound (prior working lock — retired); Krag, Krall, Sprawny, Dakota (shortlist leftovers); Fern, Moss, Nebula, Symphony, Juniper, Antares, Fargo, and many others cut in chat deep dives.
- **Product URL:** `https://machiilabs.com/skagway`
- **Voice:** indie software lab shipping multiple Mac products; Skagway is the first public proof of craft (free forever), not the company’s only bet
- **Studio home (`machiilabs.com/`):** short lab story + Skagway as free flagship; room for “coming next” (e.g. Ketchikan) without overselling
- **Do not** style the public studio brand as “Machii” (one word) — always **Mach II**
- **Before ship:** light USPTO / handle pass on Skagway

**Distribution (locked):** Direct download via **Developer ID + notarized DMG** — not Mac App Store first. App is unsandboxed ([`Skagway.entitlements`](../Skagway/Skagway.entitlements)) so it can browse arbitrary folders and optionally use ffmpeg. MAS would require a separate sandboxing project ([`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) Phase 4) and would lower power-user appeal; **do not** pursue MAS for the free-forever launch. Keep ffmpeg as the re-encode engine (no AVFoundation-only replacement as the sole path).

Defaults:
- **Studio domain:** `machiilabs.com` (Cloudflare DNS/nameservers) — sole public web presence
- **Skagway price:** free forever
- Wire DNS when site ships

## Part A — Licensing: free forever (no gate)

**No LicenseManager, no Paddle, no Keychain founding stamp, no Buy / Enter key UI for Skagway.**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  launch[App launch] --> full[Full app unlocked]
  site[Product website] --> dmg[Notarized DMG download]
  dmg --> launch
```

### Public promise (required)

1. Site, FAQ, About, and press kit: **“Skagway is free forever.”**
2. Never show a paywall, trial countdown, or “Buy” for Skagway.
3. Optional later: quiet “Support Mach II Labs” / tip link — never framed as unlocking features.
4. Do not imply early users are “founding” in a way that suggests later users will pay for Skagway.

### Distro

Developer ID sign + notarize DMG; host under `/downloads/Skagway.dmg` (or equivalent). CTA = **Download free**.

### Tip jar

Out of scope as revenue. Optional “Support Mach II Labs” link later only.

---

## Part B — Professional website

### Starting point (exists today)

Hobby-framed pages already live at:
- [`/other-fun-stuff/Skagway`](file:///Volumes/SSD/CursorProjects/kleimeyer-dot-com/src/app/other-fun-stuff/Skagway/page.jsx) — overview + Download
- [`/other-fun-stuff/Skagway/guide`](file:///Volumes/SSD/CursorProjects/kleimeyer-dot-com/src/app/other-fun-stuff/Skagway/guide/page.jsx) — user guide
- DMG href in [`constants.js`](file:///Volumes/SSD/CursorProjects/kleimeyer-dot-com/src/app/other-fun-stuff/Skagway/constants.js)

That is **not** a product site yet (buried under “other fun stuff,” personal-site chrome).

### Locked site approach

1. **Studio domain (owned):** `machiilabs.com` via Cloudflare Registrar + Cloudflare nameservers.  
2. **Hosting** — same Next.js app on Vercel; add `machiilabs.com` (and `www`) in Vercel; in Cloudflare DNS create Vercel’s records with **DNS only** (grey cloud).  
3. **App routes** — on the Mach II Labs host: `/` = studio home, `/skagway` = product, `/skagway/guide` = docs (middleware when `Host` is `machiilabs.com`).  
4. **Redirects** — `/other-fun-stuff/Skagway*` on kleimeyer.com → `https://machiilabs.com/skagway` (301).  
5. **Standalone product chrome** — no personal-site / OFS nav; wordmark **Mach II Labs** + **Skagway**.  
6. **CTAs:** primary **Download free**; secondary **User guide**. Pricing section = **Free forever** (one line, unambiguous).  
7. **Legal / support** — `support@machiilabs.com` (Email Routing). No Paddle for Skagway.

Env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_SITE_URL=https://machiilabs.com/skagway`

### SEO (locked: category-first, not brand-first)

Almost nobody will search **Skagway** at launch. They search jobs: **Mac video catalog**, **Mac video organizer**, **Mac video library**, **organize videos on Mac**, **video manager Mac**, **local video library Mac**, and peers (**VidHub alternative**, **Infuse Mac library**, **Cinematica alternative**).

**Rules**
- Brand is for recognition after discovery; **SEO copy targets category queries**.
- Title / H1 / meta: lead with the job, brand second (e.g. “Mac Video Organizer & Library — Skagway”).
- One primary landing for the product; supporting pages or sections that match search intent without keyword stuffing.
- Comparison / alternative pages earn high-intent traffic (“X alternative”, “X vs Y”).
- Guide content = long-tail (“how to organize a large video library on Mac”).
- OG / social same as brand; search snippets optimized for category.

**On-page (machiilabs.com/skagway)**
- `<title>` + meta description: category phrase + outcome (fast / large libraries / files stay put) + Skagway + free
- H1: category-led; logo/wordmark still Skagway
- Body: natural use of catalog / organizer / library / Mac; avoid stuffing
- FAQ answers real queries (free forever, why not Mac App Store / sandbox, ffmpeg optional, vs Infuse/Plex/Cinematica)
- Internal links: studio home ↔ product ↔ guide ↔ compare

**Supporting URLs (same host)**
- `/skagway` — primary product landing  
- `/skagway/guide` — docs + long-tail how-tos  
- `/skagway/vs-cinematica` (and optional `/skagway/vs-infuse`) — alternative intent  
- Optional blog later: “Best Mac video organizers” style posts only if honest and maintained

**Technical SEO**
- Canonical `https://machiilabs.com/skagway` (and per-page canonicals)
- `sitemap.xml` + robots for machiilabs.com host
- Fast Core Web Vitals; real screenshots with descriptive `alt` (“Mac video library grid…”)
- JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` (name Skagway, OS macOS, category); **offers as free** permanently
- 301 OFS Skagway → `/skagway` (equity + discovery)

**Directories / listings (off-site)**
- MacUpdate, AlternativeTo, Softpedia, Product Hunt: title/tagline = category language first; price = Free
- Press tips: subject lines like “Free Mac video organizer for large libraries” not only “Introducing Skagway”

### Landing page structure (one composition, not a dashboard)

Hero (first viewport only):
- Brand: **Skagway** (Mach II Labs) — visible wordmark
- **Headline = SEO/job language** (organizer / catalog / library for Mac), not a cryptic brand slogan alone
- One supporting sentence (large libraries, files stay put)
- CTA group: **Download free** · User guide
- One dominant product screenshot / short loop (full-bleed or edge-to-edge visual — not a card collage)

Below the fold (one job per section):
- **Why it’s different** — fast with thousands of videos (confirmed vs Cinematica)
- **What you get** — grid, tags, smart collections, albums, player, metadata I/O; library + cache location you control (tight bullets)
- **How it works** — indexes folders; files stay put
- **Pricing** — **Free forever.** Full app, no trial, no paid tier. (Optional: Mach II Labs may sell other products later; Skagway stays free.)
- **Compare** — short honest table vs Cinematica (performance + modern UX) and vs Infuse (organization depth)
- **FAQ** — free forever, why not App Store, system requirements (macOS 26+), ffmpeg for re-encode, no data sent to Mach II Labs, library/cache on encrypted volumes vs FileVault
- **Footer** — support email, guide, GitHub releases optional

### Technical

- Next.js routes under product path (`/skagway`)
- Keep guide content; restyle shell to match product brand
- Screenshots: export from Release build (Curated Wall + player + filters) — dark cinematic look is the brand

---

## Part C — Marketing around launch

### Positioning line (use everywhere)

> Skagway is a fast Mac app for organizing and playing the video files already on your drives — built to stay smooth with large libraries.

**Search / SEO phrasing (titles, directories, ads — not instead of brand):** Mac video organizer · Mac video catalog · Mac video library manager.

**Free-forever line:** Serious Mac video organizer — free forever from Mach II Labs.

Wedge vs Cinematica: **same job, dramatically better at scale.**  
Not competing as Infuse/Plex clone.

### Asset checklist

- **Demo library (not personal media):** `python3 scripts/download_demo_library.py` → `~/Movies/Skagway-Demo-Library/` (~25 clips each: Landscape, Architecture, Arts & Crafts, Automotive). Add that folder as a Skagway data source for screenshots / manuals. Credit Pixabay on public marketing that uses the clips.
- 4–6 stills (wall, inspector, filters, player, collections) with descriptive alts for SEO
- 30–60s silent or lightly captioned demo (download → browse → filter → play)
- App icon + social OG image (1200×630)
- Press kit zip (icon, screenshots, one-pager PDF/Markdown)
- Compare page copy (Cinematica; optional Infuse) aimed at “alternative” queries

### Launch channels (lightweight, sequential)

1. Product site live + notarized DMG (SEO title/meta/JSON-LD day one); **free forever** copy live  
2. Short post: personal network / X / LinkedIn  
3. Mac-focused: MacStories tip inbox, Softpedia/MacUpdate — **category taglines** + free forever  
4. Communities: r/MacApps sparingly (value-first)  
5. Product Hunt once site + DMG are stable  
6. Comparison pages on machiilabs.com  

### In-app ↔ site consistency

- No Buy nag; no license gate  
- About links to `/skagway` and guide; may state free forever  
- Optional tip / support link only — never feature-gated  
- **Check for Updates** and **Report a Problem / Contact** land on the same honest support story as the site (not a dead mailto void)

---

## Part G — Updates + user communication (added 2026-07-13)

Public free software still needs a **trustworthy update path** and a **reachable human channel**. Neither is monetization.

### Check for updates

**Goal:** Users on notarized DMG installs can learn about and install newer Skagway builds without hunting GitHub manually.

**Direction (decide at implement time):**
- Prefer **Sparkle** (or similar) with an appcast hosted under `machiilabs.com` (e.g. `/skagway/appcast.xml`) alongside DMG downloads
- In-app: **Skagway → Check for Updates…** (and optional quiet periodic check)
- About / site show current version; release notes link to changelog or short release page
- Signing: update packages must match the public **Developer ID** story (not ad-hoc)

**Not required for day-one soft launch** if downloads are infrequent and you announce on the site — but should land **before** wide press / PH so early adopters aren’t stranded on build 1.

### Bug reporting / ticketing / communication

**Goal:** Users can report bugs and ask questions; Mach II Labs can triage without drowning.

**Direction (pick one primary + optional secondary):**
- **Email:** `support@machiilabs.com` (already in studio plan) — simplest; in-app “Contact Support…” / “Report a Problem…”
- **Public tracker:** GitHub Issues on the Skagway repo (or a dedicated support repo) — good for transparency; needs labels/templates so noise stays manageable
- **Light in-app reporter (optional later):** prefill app version, macOS version, and a short description; send via email or open a prefilled issue URL — **user-initiated only; no app telemetry by default** (locked privacy principle above)

**Process:** short triage SLA for yourself (even “best effort”); FAQ on site for common issues (sandbox/MAS, ffmpeg, removable volumes). Reuse the same channel for Ketchikan later where possible.

---

## Implementation sequence

0. **Part F Track A + B** — organizer polish + grid card chrome MVP (overlays/vignette); posters/TMDB optional later  
1. Confirm customer-facing Skagway naming + About “free forever” copy  
2. Notarized DMG → public downloads  
3. Domain → Vercel → `/skagway` + OFS redirects + **free forever** copy + SEO  
4. Screenshots / demo / OG / FAQ (show jazzed grid cards)  
5. Soft free launch → press / PH  
6. **Check for updates** (Sparkle/appcast) + **support / bug channel** live on site and in-app  
7. ~~Optional library lock (Part D)~~ — **cancelled**; document Choose Folder / encrypted-volume guidance on site FAQ instead  
8. Track C power/AI as post-launch differentiators  
9. Update ROADMAP  

## Effort ballpark

| Workstream | Calendar |
|------------|----------|
| Notarized DMG pipeline | ~1–3 days |
| Professional site + assets | ~1–2 weeks |
| Check for updates (Sparkle + appcast) | ~2–5 days |
| Bug/support channel (email + optional Issues/in-app) | ~1–3 days |
| ~~Library privacy lock (Part D)~~ | cancelled — library/cache home on encrypted volume |
| Launch marketing push | ~2–5 days around ship |
| **Total to credible public launch** | **~2–5 weeks** (no licensing workstream) |
| iOS companion player | separate project after Mac GTM |

## Part D — Library / cache location (replaces Library Lock)

**Status:** **Shipped approach** (startup chooser + Change Library & Cache Location…). In-app password/Touch ID Library Lock is **cancelled**.

**Decision (2026-07-23):** Skagway is not a vault and will not encrypt the catalog in-app. Users who keep media on an encrypted volume already have the right primitive: put the **`.machii` library and `Skagway-cache`** on that same volume via **Choose Folder…**. When the volume is locked or offline, the catalog and previews are unavailable too — without SQLCipher, unlock gates, or performance cost on every browse.

**What we tell users (startup + FAQ):**

- None of your data is ever sent to Mach II Labs or anywhere else (no account, no cloud sync, no usage analytics). Optional update checks do not upload library or media.
- Skagway does not modify or protect source media.
- You control where the library catalog and thumbnail cache live.
- Media on an encrypted volume → Choose Folder… and co-locate library + `Skagway-cache` on that volume.
- Then choose **Remember this location** (opaque bookmark on this Mac) or **Ask every time** (no location stored on the boot disk; open the library each launch).
- Media on a normal volume → standard location (Application Support + Caches) is fine.
- The cache location is app-wide (shared by every library).

**Explicitly still rejected:** Encrypting video files at rest, or ingesting media into a giant DB blob store. Privacy for the files themselves remains OS FileVault / volume encryption + folder permissions.

**Historical note:** An earlier plan sketched App Lock + encrypted GRDB/thumbnails (password, Touch ID, Keychain DEK, auto-lock). That is superseded; do not implement unless product direction changes.

### Sequencing vs GTM

- Library/cache home chooser is already in-app; site FAQ should mirror the startup copy
- **Full video-file vault** and **iOS companion player** stay out of this GTM pass

---

## Part E — Post-launch: iOS companion player

**Not a launch blocker.** Named follow-on after Mac GTM is stable.

- Mac app runs local library server (Bonjour discover, pair PIN/token, stream)
- iOS app **Skagway Player**: browse + play on LAN first
- Pairing / server allowlist — do **not** depend on a cancelled in-app library lock; gate on explicit user allow + volume availability
- Format reality: compatible files direct-stream; incompatible need later transcode story
- AirPlay from Mac remains the zero-app shortcut until companion ships

---

## Part F — Nuke the competition: best organizer + pretty library look

**Locked product bar (2026-07-11):** Be the **best Mac local video organizer** of them all — not merely the best free one — **and** make the library **look intentional**. Do **not** pivot primary identity into Infuse/VidHub (Netflix-style scrape-first media browser). Beat them on organization depth; close the “utilitarian grid” gap with visual polish that works for **all** files (home video, cuts, random MP4s) — not only titled movies.

**Competitive map**
| Peer | Their strength | How Skagway wins |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Cinematica** | Direct organizer peer | Outpace on large-library speed, modern UX, filters/collections/albums, metadata I/O, reliability |
| **Videlion / Movie Explorer** | Lightweight catalog | Deeper power tools + playback + queues + polished grid cards |
| **Infuse / VidHub** | Poster walls, scrape, playback polish | Don’t copy their whole product; **borrow visual density** via card chrome (and optional posters later); stay superior at tags/rules/albums/custom fields/scale |
| **NeoFinder** | Offline drive catalog | Video-native playback + curation workflows |

**Already strong (defend & polish, don’t rebuild):** in-place library, Grid/List + Inspector, Quick/Advanced filters, smart collections, albums, tags/ratings/custom fields, CSV/JSON metadata I/O, multi-mode playback, thumbnails/filmstrips, re-encode/move queues, large-library performance architecture.

### Track A — Organizer supremacy (ship before bragging)

Priority polish that makes “best” believable:
1. **v1.0 readiness** — formal 10k+ perf pass, feature audit vs ROADMAP, security pass on filesystem/ffmpeg paths ([`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md))
2. **Zero papercuts** — import/scan reliability, Missing/Corrupt/Duplicates workflows, selection/playback edge cases, keyboard completeness
3. **Auto-import from Data Sources** — watch folders stay fresh without manual Scan (roadmap gap)
4. **Notes field** — searchable, filterable, exportable
5. **Richer search** — beyond filename FTS5: tags, notes, custom fields, path (even before full semantic AI)
6. **Batch power** — multi-select operations feel inevitable, not bolted on
7. **Library/cache on encrypted volumes** — document Choose Folder… (Part D); no in-app Library Lock
8. **Real user guide** — stub [`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`](USER_GUIDE.md) → product-grade guide on site

### Track B — Pretty library look (revised 2026-07-11)

**MVP (preferred first): jazzed-up grid thumbnails** — no TMDB required. Works for every file in a personal library.

Card chrome on the existing thumbnail (composited in UI or cached “display still”):
1. **Title overlay** — readable filename/title on the card (gradient scrim so type stays legible)
2. **Vignette / edge shade** — slight cinematic falloff so stills feel framed, not flat
3. **Status badges** — resume progress, subtitles, rating stars, duration chip (tighten what’s already there into one coherent card language)
4. **Selection / hover** — premium focus ring and hover lift without cheap gloss
5. **Optional type treatments** — truncate smartly; show custom title field when present later
6. **Performance** — must not tank 10k grid scroll (prefer SwiftUI overlays on existing `ThumbnailService` images; avoid re-encoding every thumb unless caching a composed variant proves necessary)

**Why this beats “posters first” for Skagway:** most of the target library isn’t a TMDB movie. Overlays + vignette upgrade **100%** of cards; posters only upgrade matchable titles.

**Later (optional Track B2): posters / artwork**
- Manual poster set/clear / “use current frame”
- Opt-in TMDB (or similar) match + reject/alt
- Poster-forward grid mode when art exists; else fall back to jazzed thumbnail
- Only after MVP chrome feels premium in screenshots

**Later (optional Track B3): AI “Hollywood” covers (user-supplied key)**
- For users who paste their own API key (OpenAI / other image model — pick one provider at implement time): generate a stylized movie-poster cover from title + optional still/keyframes + short prompt
- **Bring-your-own-key only** — Mach II Labs does not foot inference cost; key stays in Keychain; never shipped as a required cloud account
- Opt-in per video or batch (“Generate cover…”); preview → Accept / Retry / Discard; never auto-overwrite without confirm
- Store accepted art as normal poster/artwork on disk (same path as B2); grid uses it like any poster
- Honest UI: “Uses your API key; may leave your Mac; costs apply on your provider account”
- Fits personal libraries with no TMDB hit (home video, cuts, private titles) where a cinematic fake cover still looks premium
- Privacy default: off; no key → feature hidden or disabled with short explanation
- Out of B3 scope: training on user libraries; bundling a studio-paid quota; generating without explicit user action

**Explicitly out of Track B MVP:** scrape-first identity; Plex/Jellyfin client; Apple TV app; HDR codec wars; AI covers (that’s B3).

### Track C — Power features that widen the gap

After A+B MVP are convincing:
- Near-duplicate / perceptual similarity (beyond SHA-256)
- Filename/path auto-tag suggestions (local heuristics first; vision AI later per [`AI-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](../AI-IMPROVEMENTS.md))
- Natural-language → collection rules (local or hybrid)
- Semantic search (Phase 3) once notes + richer fields exist to embed
- Posters/TMDB (B2) if screenshots still feel thin vs Infuse

### Sequencing vs free launch

```

- **Minimum for “best organizer” claim:** Track A visibly ahead of Cinematica.
- **Minimum for “looks premium”:** Track B card chrome MVP in marketing screenshots.
- Don’t block launch on TMDB/posters or AI covers.
- Studio credibility = craft on A + B chrome, not feature-count vs Infuse.

### Marketing claim language (use carefully)

- Yes: “The fastest, most powerful Mac app for organizing the videos already on your drives — with a library that looks as good as it works. Free forever.”
- No: “Infuse killer” / “best media player on Apple platforms.”
- No: “Free during launch” / “founding users stay free when we start charging.”

---

## Out of scope for this GTM pass

- Mac App Store / StoreKit  
- Sandboxing Skagway for MAS (keeps ffmpeg + multi-drive power)  
- **Any paid flip, Paddle, LicenseManager, or founding Keychain for Skagway**  
- Heavy DRM / anti-piracy theater  
- Subscriptions (Mach II Labs never)  
- Full multi-language marketing site  
- Paid ads (evaluate after organic signal)  
- Encrypting video files at rest (full vault)  
- iOS companion player implementation (post-launch only)  
- Primary pivot to Infuse/VidHub-style scrape-first streaming product (pretty metadata is additive, not a rewrite)  
- Replacing ffmpeg with AVFoundation-only re-encode as the sole path (would drop WMV / many AVI fixes)
